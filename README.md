# Court-Booking

This is a respository of a project I am currently working on, which aims at allowing smoother functioning of the sports courts in and around SAC.
This provides an easy way for the students of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus to book time-slots to play at the sports courts.
Currently, I am working on bookings for the badminton court, but expansion to the tennis court, table-tennis court and basketball courts are also in the road map.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
I will try my best to get the most accurate information, but for now, it is a sample.
It is not official. You cannot book through this program and expect the court to be free.
For now, it only allows one person to book two hours per day
